   <p class="lead">
      I am a developer and technical project manager based in Philly 
      with 10+ years of experience in non-profit and research settings.
      <br>
      My background is in software engineering, social science, and grants/data management.
      I like to build software solutions in social service settings and understand the implications of these systems.
      The focus of my work is&#58;
      <br>1) Developing socio-technical systems to facilitate effective processes
      <br>2) Building open-source projects to advance knowledge infrastructures
      <br>3) Harnessing data to serve people, instead of the other way around

    <p class="lead">
      I started my career in non-profits, many of which had limited resources to
      build information systems, so data was most often stored in one of three places&#58; 
      spreadsheets saved on someone's desktop locally, paper files locked away in a filing cabinet,
      or the memory of staff.
      <br> Trying to build systems that transformed these ways of knowing into open, digital spaces, 
      I ran into the limits of data in social service settings. 
      I knew that what was being quantified systematically was a compressed, flat representation of the work of staff and yet it was used for funding and decision-making.
      <br> I became interested in understanding the limits of prediction and explanation using data. This drove me to join the <a href="https://css.seas.upenn.edu/">CSSLab</a>,
      which unites computer science, statistics, and social science using digital data and platforms
      to study people.
