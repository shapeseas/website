## CSSLab

Now I manage software development teams building [open-source infrastructure](https://github.com/Watts-Lab) for the lab and larger social science communities, write and manage production and test code for various web applications, including the [deliberation portal](https://github.com/Watts-Lab/researcher-portal), and train incoming lab contributors on our [open-science protocols](https://css.seas.upenn.edu/about/lab/).

#### Building open science and software

Many of the research projects utilize version control (Git) for code and data, as well as GitHub to manage the repositories remotely and track task completion. Teams implement version control in a production-level environment where we check out branches, run automated tests, deal with merge conflicts, rebase to clean up commits, and use issues to track progress.

#### Managing agile research

As a key practice within these projects, we run agile stand-ups with the members of the teams and teach incoming code contributors how to use Git/GitHub. Building on this work, in 2023 I applied and was selected to participate in the Research Transparency and Reproducbility Training (RT2) hosted by [BITSS](https://www.bitss.org/) at Berkeley, along with researchers in the social sciences from around the world.
