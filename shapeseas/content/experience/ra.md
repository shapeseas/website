## Research Associate

Many researchers in academia and non-profits at this point in time (and probably still today), used spreadsheets, as well as point-and-click statistical software like SPSS. As part of a few contracts, I used both of these technologies.

#### Heading into the cloud

Google spreadsheets was becoming more and more capable, so I made the switch from Microsoft Excel to Google sheets. Part of my work required matching survey responses so I learned vlookups formulas, and later query formulas. I learned alot from [Ben Collins](https://www.benlcollins.com/).
