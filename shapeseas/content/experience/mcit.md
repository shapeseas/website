## MCIT

I began my graduate studies to deepen my computer science knowledge and practice. While I had learned alot from YouTube University, I was missing some of the fundamental instruction that computer science programs provide. In 2019 I applied to and was accepted into the [Master of Computer and Information Technology Online](https://online.seas.upenn.edu/course-catalog/mcit-online/) graduate program at Penn Engineering. Once the pandemic started, many graduate programs were upended, but MCIT Online had the infrastructure in place to continue.

#### Learning the fundamentals

I took courses in software development, data structures, discrete math, algorithms, computer/operating systems, computer and network security, wireless communications, networked systems, and database and information systems. One project as part of my studies resulted in `See the Science`.

##### See the Science

As part of a database course team project, I developed a web application to view information on the extraordinary, the ordinary, and the ugly sides of scientific publishing, including information on scientific authors, papers, grants prize-winning papers and retracted papers from around the world.

Working in and around the social sciences, I wanted to spotlight the production of science so I pitched this to the team. I led the front-end and API development and collaborated on a [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Witku_fJgD4), project design document, and web application in a team of four.

Key features include:

\- React front-end, including debounced author search and pagination to optimize display time

\- Express API, with pagination, filtering, ordering, and searching to serve information on scientists, papers, summary statistics, and co-authorship distance using Breadth-first search algorithm

\- Normalized MySQL database with over 15 tables deployed on AWS RDS

\- Merged data from 5 sources with over 140,000 authors, 47,000 articles, 11,000 grants, 44,000 institutions, including metadata on prize-winning papers and retractions
